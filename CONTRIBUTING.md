# What I need it?
When I need wrote some simple applications to store data some tasks are common, maybe a small library to turn this work more fast can help me and help others, no?
Some programmers and students have much tasks to do, and most of then make you to spend time.
Thinking about it, i wrote some years ago, this simple lirbary, but recently, I lean in publish and use git public resources.
If you can study with me I try share my knownledge about programming and other sciences with I study.
The goal of some studies is not turned only to tecnological tecniques, but also to relationship between human sciences and math areas.
Using one simple interface, based on **CLI**, with input, output simple methods I can build a functional database application.
Also using _Tk_ to produce **GUI** interfaces resources I can improve the database access in same class and funcions structure.
The base class, permits a good integrations, and usage of input/output of data to database.
Grateful, andyou are welcome to  this project.
