## first versions.

My first studdies are turned to only build an simple environment.

This environment create sqlite database, and make one integration with this database and Tk ***GUI* and __CLI__ simple iterfaces.

On the second moment i try made one CLI interface on same database controoled by class.

This goal, are satisfied.

The base class, is based in one multidimensional array data type.

That show a simple use of these data types.

The integration with CLI and GUI interface are builded by base class.

The base class provide, insert and select funcions.

Also are provide one simple find method.

One rule for base class use, is at moment, is needed one data member "id" on any derived class.
