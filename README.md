## asl-sl

Academia do software livre.

São Lourenço, Minas Gerais - Brazil.


the goal of the dStorage meta class is study and implements some other classes.

The project structure need a special atention for learn in github usage.

the dStorage class give some funcions to create databases, and automaticaly
generate a gui and console interface for the data class and database.

Examples of usage are included in examples directory.

## first versions.

My first studies are turned to only build a simple environment.

This environment create SQLite database, and make one integration with this database and Tk **GUI** and __CLI__ simple iterfaces.

On the second moment i try made one CLI interface on same database controlled by base class structures.

This goal, are satisfied.

The base class, is based in one multidimensional array data type.

That show an simple use of these data types.

The integration with CLI and GUI interface are builded by base class.

The base class provide, insert and select funcions.

Also are provide one simple find method.

One rule for base class use, is at moment, is needed one data member "id" on any derived class.

## Current.

The current version have insert, select, drop, data functions.

Also have some good options like optimization of file paths and colors for dialogs on **GUI.**

The library can be installed using python [**pip.**](https://pypi.org/project/dStorage/)

> python -m pip install --user dStorage

> the actual upstream release is on current [**git**](https://github.com/leo0-07/dStorage) branch.

During a long time i teach use, administration and development with some UNIX Like operating systems.

Excuse some troubles in my codes, i try be better....

Grateful.
Special thanks to python comunity for the oportunity to colaborate.
Excuse for my troublrd in package construction, i need more pratice and for me is hard to restart on the right way. Some lectures are not clearly for my compreension, and i only can say forgive me for my limitations.
