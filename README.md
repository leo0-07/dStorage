## first versions.

My first studdies are turned to only build an simple environment.

This environment create aq database, and make one integration with this database and Tk simple iterface.

This goal, are satisfied.

On the second moment i try made one CLI interface on same database controoled by class.

The base class, create one multidimensional array data type.

That show a simple use of these data types.

The integration with CLI and GUI interface are builded by base class.

The base class provide, insert and select funcions.

Also are provided one simple find method.

One rule for base class use, is at moment, is needed one data member "id" on any derived class.
