The goal of the dStorage metaclass is study and implements some other classes.

The project structure need a special attention for learning in github usage.

The dStorage class gives some functions to create databases and automaticaly
generate a gui and console interface for the data class and database.

Examples of usage are included in directory's examples.

## first versions.

My first studies are turned only to build a simple environment.

This environment creates SQLite database, and makes one integration with this database and Tk **GUI** and __CLI__ simple interfaces.

On the second moment I tried make one CLI interface on same database controlled by base class structure.

This goal were satisfied.

The base class, is based in one multidimensional array data type.

That show a simple use of these data types.

The integration with CLI and GUI interface are built by base class.

The base class provide, insert, delete and select functions.

Also are provided one simple find method.

One rule for base class uses, is at moment, is necessary one data member "id" on any derived class.

## Current.

The current version have insert, select, delete functions  data.
